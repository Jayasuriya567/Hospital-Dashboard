# Hospital-Dashboard #PowerBI # Data Amalyst

I have completed a Power BI project using a hospital dataset, and I wanted to share how this report addresses specific analytical questions:

1. **Bed Type Occupancy**: The report reveals that the most utilized bed type by patients is Private Beds, accounting for approximately 3.6k instances, compared to General Beds (2.4k) and ICU Beds (1.2k).

2. **Top-Notch Doctor Feedback**: Using a pie chart, I identified that Dr. Mark Joy received the highest feedback score (> 4.0) from patients.

3. **Most Visited Patients with Diagnosis**: The analysis highlights that Viral Infection is the most frequent diagnosis among patients, contrasting with fewer instances of Fracture Injuries.

4. **Billing Insights**: Through a line chart, the report illustrates the relationship between the total bill amount and the insurance coverage amount.

To achieve this, I employed Power Query to clean the dataset by removing null values and adjusting data types before loading it into Power BI. The report includes essential KPIs such as Admission Date, Discharge Date, Follow-up Date, and Patient Billing Amount. 

Users can utilize two slicers—one for Patient ID and another for Date Range—to filter data and derive relevant insights.

For a detailed view, you can access the interactive dashboard [here](https://app.powerbi.com/reportEmbed?reportId=c670eece-fe75-4b7a-8915-a629f5791d2f&autoAuth=true&ctid=2d6ceca0-9292-466b-acff-0e4e9798f993).

Feel free to explore and provide feedback on the insights presented in the report.
